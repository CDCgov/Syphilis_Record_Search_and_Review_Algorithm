## Overview

While health departments began conducting syphilis surveillance in the 1930s (consistently compiled national data are available dating back to 1941), in an effort to identify syphilis cases that might not be otherwise reported by clinicians, laboratories have been mandated to report serologies to health departments since 1962. Historical test results are routinely maintained on file to aid with interpretation of any subsequent tests. Health departments subsequently investigate reported serologies to determine if they represent a new infection, reinfection, or treatment failure. Ideally, every new reactive serology should be investigated but because of the overwhelming volume serologies reported and limited resources available at public health agencies, not all serologies are investigated. Instead, reported serologies were administratively closed using "reactor grids"  which prioritize serologies for further investigation based on patient's age, sex, test type, and test titer reported on the serology.

Reactor grids, however, are widely acknowledged to be unreliable and have shown to miss syphilis cases. Recently, researchers have suggested an algorithm that, used in conjunction with electronic laboratory reporting, might be used to automatically search historical records and apply the case definition of syphilis. We developed a computerized algorithm (demonstrated in the figure below) that could be used by any public health agency to compare reported electronic laboratory reports with prior testing and intervention history in the surveillance database of the public health agency. [This algorithm was developed using a surveillance dataset from Florida Department of Health and validated by New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene](https://journals.lww.com/stdjournal/Abstract/2021/12000/An_Automated_Syphilis_Serology_Record_Search_and.2.aspx) (please click the link to access the manuscript that described the algorithm). The goal of the algorithm is to accurately close those serologies that do not meet the case definition, and prioritize the rest for further investigation; and do so using evidence-based decisions and advances in technology and data management capabilities of public health agencies. The algorithm demonstrated an accuracy of 99.4% and would have saved an additional 590 workdays in the 3 years of surveillance data analyzed.

The goal of this GitHub repository is to serve as the one-stop location for public health agencies and technology vendors to test and implement this algorithm. Please contact Saugat Karki (SKarki@cdc.gov) for further discussion and any technical assistance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

This remains to be a continuous work in progress, please let us know if you find any errors or would like to discuss any changes. 
## Dependencies

There are 3 Python libraries necessary for this Jupyter Notebook include the following:

* Pandas
* Numpy

These libraries are called in the Python Notebook. The rest of the dependencies come installed with Python 3.

## Getting Started

### Cloning the Repository

The repository can either be downloaded from GitHub or cloned using the following command:

`$ git clone https://github.com/CDCgov/Syphilis_Record_Search_and_Review_Algorithm.git`

### Running the Notebook

Launch Jupyter Notebook (from the 'Notebooks' folder in the repository) in Anaconda or a Python 3 installation of your choice. Kindly follow the steps written in the Jupyter Notebook closely as there are some steps required to ensure that the data is in the correct format. See the notebook for specific details.
