## Overview

While health departments began conducting syphilis surveillance in the 1930s (consistently compiled national data are available dating back to 1941), , laboratories haven been madated to report serologies to health departments since 1962 in an effort to identify syphilis cases that might not be otherwise reported by clinicians. Historical test results are routinely maintained on file to aid with interpretation of any subsequent tests. Health departments subsequently investigate reported serologies to determine if they represent a new infection, reinfection, or treatment failure. Ideally, every new reactive serology should be investigated but because of the overwhelming volume serologies reported and limited resources avaibale at health departments, health departments do not investigate all reported serologies. Reported serologies were administratively closed, using "reactor grids" (examples of reactor grids in the figure below) which prioritize serologies for further investigation based on patient's age, sex, test type, and test titer.

Reactor grids, however, are widely acknowledge to be unreliable and have shown to miss syphilis cases. Recently, researchers have suggested an algorithm that used in conjuntion with electronic laboratory reporting might be used to automatically search historical records and apply the case definition of syphilis. We developed a computerized algorithm (demonstrated in the figure below) that could be used by any public health agency to compare reported electronic laboratory reports with prior testing and intervention history in the surveillance database of the public health agency. [This algorithm was developed using a surveillance dataset from Florida Department of Health and validated by New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene](https://journals.lww.com/stdjournal/Citation/2022/01000/Automating_Case_Reporting_of_Chlamydia_and.8.aspx) (click hyperlink to access the manuscript describing the algorithm). The goal of the algorithm is to accurately close those serologies that do not meet the case definition, and prioritize the rest for further investigation; and do so using evidence-based decisions and advances in technology and data management capabilities of public health agencies. The algorithm demonstrated an accuracy of 99.4% and would have saved an additional 590 workdays in the 3 years of surveillance data analyzed.

The goal of this GitHub repository is to serve as the one-stop location for public health agencies and technology vendors to test and implement this algorithm.
